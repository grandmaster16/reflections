What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we initialize a repository, it creates a repo with no initial commits. It is need to be done to keep in track of the files in fututre.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It acts as an intermediate between working directory and repository. It offers us a chance to add some small small changes without committing the whole code at once which we can do it later after making all changes in the staging area.
